Solar System Quantum Geometry Engine

A web application for analyzing geometric similarity between planetary alignments across time.
By comparing a user-selected date against a defined time interval, the system calculates the percentage of spatial resonance between planetary geometries.

This tool represents the first foundational module in a far-reaching AI designed for the cosmic quantification of past and future events.

Fields of Application

Astronomy & Planetary Physics

Geophysics & Seismology

Quantum Mechanics & Quantum Computing

Historical Pattern Analysis & Predictive Sociology

Purpose

To detect recurring cosmic geometries that may correlate with historical events or future anomaliesâ€”whether seismic, societal, life events, consciousness ascension or systemic.
This engine is the starting point toward a multidimensional, AI-assisted model of planetary influence on time-linked phenomena.
